## Description

I found this hard problem online, and I thought since it was a hard problem, it must be a good starting point for a cryptosystem since I know that they rely on hard problems.

The problem relies on the function are_equidistant_to_point_on_closest_line(x,y) which can be described as follows: Given two points, x and y, within the unit square, the function is true if there is a point on the edge of the square closest to point x, that is equidistant from both x and y. Since it is a hard problem, it's up to you to implement the function!

For this challenge I will prove how secure the system is, by allowing you to generate as many different keys as you want, and use them to encrypt your own texts.
