## Description

A blazingly-fast, memory-safe, CRUD-compatible note-taking app written in nearly 1000 lines of safe Rust. No unsafe and no memory errors, yet still a pwn challenge. Everything looks safe. Everything compiles. Even clippy is happy. But something still feels off, and it's not Rust's fault.
