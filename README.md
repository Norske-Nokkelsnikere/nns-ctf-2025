# NNS CTF 2025

Writeups and (soon) challenge resources for the [NNS CTF 2025](https://ctftime.org/event/2684) event.

## Submitting Writeups

Each challenge has its own directory under [writeups](./writeups) in the following format:
`[primary category]/[challenge slug]`.

When submitting writeups, please create a directory using the following structure:

`[primary category]/[challenge slug]/[team name]`

Example structure, given the team "NNS":
```
- writeups
  - beginner
    - babyrsa
      - NNS          <- Your team name
        - solve.py   <- Solve script
        - README.md  <- The writeup itself
        - ...
```

For each writeup, please include a `README.md` and preferably a solve script (if applicable).
